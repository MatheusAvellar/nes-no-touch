## FAQ

### Why?

Because! Learning is fun!

### Your code is a mess!

That's not a question, but yes. First time coding in Assembly, cut me some slack!

### Why are some instructions in uppercase, and some in lowercase? Are you a maniac?

Uppercase instructions were plainly copied from somewhere, and I haven't put in
the work to fully understand what they do yet. Once I do, and I deem them
necessary/useful, I'll convert them to lowercase.

### When will it be finished?

No clue whatsoever, but it'll probably take some years.

## Bibliography / Special Thanks

- The [NesDev wiki](https://wiki.nesdev.com/), although very far from perfect,
has some pretty useful information about the NES and its quirks;

- A great part of this work was only possible due to the efforts of
"[bunnyboy, MetalSlime, Taywee](https://taywee.github.io/NerdyNights/index.html)"
(and whoever the author of the original tutorials was);

- The video "[Deconstructing NES Music using Famitracker](https://youtu.be/MQGfuRM2XQo)",
by [Chris Plays Games](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQRqhw3y8rpH4Gkl0ZVTRPw),
helped me understand how Famitracker works a little better;
